# FASTANN: A library for fast approximate nearest neighbours

## [James Philbin](philbinj@gmail.com)

The plan is to support a number of different approximate nearest
neighbour routines and possibly different distance norms. At the
moment only the Euclidean distance is supported with the following
methods:

- Exact NN

- Approximate k-d trees

Both methods use some fairly optimized distance functions (though
these can be improved).


## INSTALLATION                                                     

Before installation the following requirements should be met:

- Linux

- CMake >= 2.6.0

- Yasm (http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/) (OPTIONAL)


Build the library for installing to /usr/local/ (default /usr/)

> PREFIX=/usr/local/ cmake . && make

Test the library (everything should say PASSED)

> make test

Time the routines

> make perf

Install the library to $PREFIX/include and $PREFIX/lib

> make install


## INTERFACES

The Python interface has the following requirements:

- Python >= 2.5.0

- Numpy >= 1.2.0

Install (as root)

> cd interfaces/python && python setup.py install


## USAGE                                                             

See examples/


## TODO

In no particular order:

- Better use of cache in kdtree. This might involve using prefetches,
  re-ordering the points in some way or even placing the point data in
  the nodes.

- Other types of approximate search such as LSH and Spectral Hashing.
